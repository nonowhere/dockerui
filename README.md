## DockerUI

DockerUI is a web interface to interact with the Remote API.  The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage docker.  This project is not complete and is still under heavy development.

### Quickstart 

#### Step 1
  
Pull the latest image:  
  
```
docker pull zaraki673/dockerui:latest
```
  
#### Step 2
If you're running Docker using a unix socket (default):  
  
```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock \
--name dockerui zaraki673/dockerui:latest -e="/docker.sock"
```
  
If you're running Docker over tcp:  
  
```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name dockerui \
zaraki673/dockerui:latest -e="http://<dockerd host ip>:4243"
```
  
#### Step 3
Open your browser to `http://<dockerd host ip>:9000`  
  
#### Warning
Bind mounting the unix socket into the DockerUI container is much more secure than exposing your docker 
daemon over TCP. You should still secure your DockerUI instance behind some type of auth.  Maybe running 
Nginx infront of DockerUI with basic auth.

### Goals
* Little to no dependencies - I really want to keep this project a pure html/js app.  I know this will have to change so that I can introduce authentication and authorization along with managing multiple docker endpoints. 
* Consistency - The web UI should be consistent with the commands found on the docker CLI.

### Stack
* Angular.js
* Flatstrap
* Spin.js
* Ace editor

### Todo:
* Full repository support
* Search
* Push files to a container
* Unit tests
